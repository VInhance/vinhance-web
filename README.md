## ✨ Features

### 📊 Smart Attendance

Never worry about the 75% rule again. VInhance calculates exactly how many classes you can skip across both Theory and Lab, complete with real-time visual alerts and future attendance projection directly on your dashboard.

### 🛡️ Absolute Privacy

Your data never leaves your browser. Keep your academic records secure and hide your CGPA with one click when opening VTOP in public spaces to ensure maximum privacy against shoulder surfers.

### ⚡ Quality of Life

Auto-solve captchas instantly during heavy traffic periods. Download full course materials and reference documents with just one click instead of navigating multiple menus.

### 📈 Marks & Grading Analysis

Instantly see the exact marks needed in FAT to pass each course. The extension breaks down your weightage, showing exactly what you've scored versus what you've lost, and wraps it perfectly in a clean semester overview.
